## ITP 438

Overview:

During the second half of the semester, I had to create a multiplayer first person shooter game made in Unreal Engine 4. 

Some features that I had to implement include:
- Default and grenade launcher firing modes
- Sprays and decals
- Ammo pickups
- Killstreak announcements
- Game chat (Team and All)
- Death animations
- Respawning
- Steam integration using Spacewar

While networking was a pain to learn and try to implement at first, this is probably my favorite project/assignment to have worked on. This was done for a class, with the first half of the semester being about learning some basics of Unreal Engine 4 to be applied on the second half, where I was required to program the game.

Below are some videos showcasing my work that I submitted for grading in the class.
