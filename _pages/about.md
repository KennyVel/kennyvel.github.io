Hello, I’m Kenny

I’m a USC graduate currently residing in Calfornia, born and raised in Socal. Coding for games is how I grew to enjoy coding throughout college.

In my free time, I mainly watch anime, read manga, go to the gym, and play video games with friends.

Top 3 manga/anime:

Land of the Lustrous, March Comes in like a Lion, Freiren: Beyond Journey’s End

Games I currently grind:

Destiny 2 and Apex Legends
