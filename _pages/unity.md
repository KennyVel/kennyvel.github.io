## Tiled Heroes

Tiled Heroes is a strategy game playable on PC and mobile devices. The player has to use the few units provided to them to destroy every enemy in the level, for a few levels. 

This was a project that I worked on as the final project for a mobile games class in college. Unlike all the other assignments in the class before this one, I had both complete control over what I wanted to create, and no guidance besides a list of criteria.

For this game, I implemented:
- Levels with different tile maps using Tiled
- Unit movement, attacks, and counterattacking
- Movement and attack range grid display
- Undo movement and end turn buttons
- Simplified enemy AI
- Input for mobile devices and PC
